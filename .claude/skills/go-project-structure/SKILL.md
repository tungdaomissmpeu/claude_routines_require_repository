# Go Project Structure

Follow this layout when adding or organizing code for Go services and applications.

## Directory Layout

| Directory     | Purpose                                                                                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cmd/{app}/`  | Loads config from env, wires dependencies, starts the app                                         |
| `pkg/model/`  | Domain data structures and related errors (for cross-package error matching).                     |
| `pkg/logic/`  | Business logic, interfaces. Testable without external dependencies.                               |
| `pkg/driver/` | Implements interfaces for external interactions (HTTP, database, third-party APIs, etc.)          |
| `pkg/base/`   | Shared pure utilities with no business logic (logger, uuid, ...). Can be imported by any package. |
| `config/`     | Configuration files. `.env.example` lists env vars to configure.                                  |
| `web/`        | Optional simple UI if needed. Served with the API. JS calls API by relative paths.                |
| `doc/`        | Design docs, user guides, tech specs, algorithms, API specs                                       |

## Conventions

### `cmd/`

Contains the main service executable and any optional one-off scripts,
one subdirectory each.

The subdirectory name determines the default binary name from `go build`,
so use a meaningful name rather than something generic like `main`.

Multi-word executable names use hyphens, following common CLI conventions,
for example `script-import-data`.

Source file names use `snake_case`, following Go conventions,
for example `script_import_data.go`.

### `pkg/model/`

- Keep everything in a single `model.go` file, or split into one file per entity if it grows
  too large (e.g. `product.go` containing the `Product` struct and its related errors).

### `pkg/logic/`

- `interface.go`: Defines interfaces for infrastructure and external dependencies.
- `interface_mock.go`: Mock implementations for tests or interfaces not yet implemented
  (use `MockSomething` naming for both stubs and mocks).
- `app.go`: The `App` struct holds all dependencies.
  Business logic is implemented as methods on `App`,
  or as methods on smaller structs that contain only the dependencies they need from `App`.
- Must be testable without external setup.
- Must not import any `driver` packages.
- Depends on interfaces, not concrete implementations.

### `pkg/driver/`

- Implements the interfaces defined in `pkg/logic/interface.go`.
- One subpackage per external concern:
  `database/`, `httpsvr/`, `external_provider/`, etc.
- `database/` also contains SQL migrations.
