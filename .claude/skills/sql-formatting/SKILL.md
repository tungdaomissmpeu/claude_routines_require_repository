# SQL Formatting Rules

- Use a space before opening and after closing parentheses
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- If a clause is broken across lines, indent subordinate parts one additional level
- Align columns and assignments within the same clause
- Avoid vague or abbreviated column names.
- If a column name may be unclear, clarify its meaning with a comment
  (based on the definition in documentation or related code).

## Example

```
CREATE TABLE users
(
    id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT    NOT NULL,
    ts    INTEGER NOT NULL -- created timestamp
);

UPDATE users
SET email = 'alice@example.com',
    name  = 'Alice'
WHERE id = 1
    AND active = TRUE;

INSERT INTO users (email)
VALUES ('alice@example.com')
ON CONFLICT (email)
    DO UPDATE
    SET email = excluded.email;
```
