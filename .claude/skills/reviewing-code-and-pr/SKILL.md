name: reviewing-code-and-pr
description: Review code changes and pull requests for business fit, implementation approach, regressions, observability, security, and code quality. Use when reviewing uncommitted local code changes, reviewing the latest commit against the previous commit, or reviewing a pull request.
---

## Output Format

Output the review with these sections in order:

- Verdict: APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES.
- Summary: describing what the change does and how it meets the review criteria.
- Blockers: issues that must be resolved before merging.
  Only present when verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES.
- Suggestions: improvements worth tracking as follow-ups.
  Not blocking: the PR still solves the business need without them.
- Nitpicks: minor observations that do not affect
  correctness or functionality.

Omit Blockers, Suggestions, and Nitpicks if they have no items.

For every item in any section, **surface the problem, not the fix.**
State what is wrong and cite the function as `funcName (file:line)`;
Do not prescribe how to fix it. The PR author can decide the fix themselves.

## Review Criteria

### Code Meets Business Need

- The PR must link to its problem source: ticket (Linear/Jira), Slack thread, plan, etc.
  If no source is linked, the PR description must state the problem being solved.
  If neither is provided, flag as blocker and ask to provide one.
- Verify the sources (ticket, report message, plan) are clear,
  self-consistent, and consistent with each other.
- For bugs: check whether we know how to reproduce it, how the root cause was confirmed,
  and whether a test reproduces the bug. If not, flag as blocker.
  Optional: symptom of a deeper issue? Check similar past bugs.

### Code Works as Intended

- Every new, modified, or affected function must have a test proving it works.
- For bug fixes: a test that reproduces the bug and passes after the fix.
- For new features: tests must cover the main use case.
  Edge cases are optional but encouraged.
- Test comments use GIVEN (precondition) / WHEN (action) / THEN (result)
  to describe business behavior, readable by non-technical stakeholders.
- Verify docs, comments, and code stay consistent.
  Compare the code to every description of its behavior:
  PR description, linked ticket, README, design docs,
  package and exported doc comments, and inline comments in or near the changed files.
  These descriptions are alternative specs: when they disagree with the code,
  the next reader trusts the wrong source or wastes time deciding which to believe.
  A mismatch is a signal: decide which side is correct before classifying.
- Severity for mismatches: wrong code is a Blocker.
  For stale descriptions (code is correct), classify by audience reach:
  misinformation in user-facing artifacts harms more readers.
  Public API docs, README, and exported doc comments are Blockers;
  internal artifacts (design docs, unexported doc comments) are Suggestions;
  stale phrasing in inline comments is a Nitpick.

### Do Not Break Existing Behavior

- Existing tests may not cover all behaviors.
  Check callers of modified functions and shared state for unintended side effects.
- Purely additive changes can still degrade performance.
  Check new queries for table scans, missing indexes, and queries inside loops.
  Check for unbounded resource growth, such as goroutines, channels, maps, or slices.
  Check for code that causes excessive load on external infrastructure.
- If the PR is too large to review confidently,
  note it as process feedback to prefer smaller PRs in future work.

### Observable Output

- Batch operations (e.g. bulk data imports, bulk updates, send group emails, etc.)
  should provide a way to inspect progress
  through metrics, a dashboard, a status API, a summary table, periodic logs, etc.
  If progress inspection or cancellation is missing, flag as suggestion.

### Security Considerations

- Check for hardcoded secrets, credentials, or real customer data in the code.
- Check that user inputs are sanitized before use in queries,
  file paths, shell commands, and rendered output.
- Check if the change exposes sensitive data in API responses or error messages.

### Code Quality

- Label nitpicks clearly so the author knows what is blocking vs optional.
- Use descriptive names for wide-scope identifiers.
  Short names only for variables used within a few nearby lines.
- Handle errors early and return immediately to keep the main path simple and avoid nesting.
- If a function returns an error, always check it. Ignore it only explicitly.
- Function signatures should clearly show inputs, outputs, and side effects.
  No hidden mutations of inputs or global state.
- Define interfaces where they are used
  so the interface consumer depends only on the required behavior,
  not the implementation package.
- Control concurrency: every goroutine must have a clear lifetime and termination condition.
- Comments should explain intent and non-obvious behavior, not just repeat the function name.
- Persist inputs and outputs for external service interactions for debugging and auditing.
  Estimate storage growth and required capacity.
- Check retryable operations are idempotent and produce the same result if retried.
- Improve the codebase where you touch it.
  Keep cleanup in separate commits from feature work for easier review and revert.
- For Go code only, run available analysis tools on the changed code:
  - `go vet`: detect suspicious or likely incorrect Go code.
  - `go fix`: automatically update code to modern Go APIs and patterns.
  - `staticcheck`: advanced static analysis for bugs, performance issues, and deprecated APIs.

### Process Feedback

If the review finds serious problems,
such as vague requirements that led to solving the wrong need,
contradictory source materials, or the wrong approach,
add recommendations to prevent similar issues in future work:

- Requirements should be clear and agreed on before coding starts.
- The solution approach should be confirmed before implementation.
- This prevents misalignment earlier in future work.
